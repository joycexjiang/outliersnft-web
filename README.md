# Outliers NFT Minting Web Page & Basic HardHat Project

This project is created through the tutorial by [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/projects), demonstrating a basic Hardhat use case. The objective was to create a web page using ReactJS where individuals can connect to their wallet and mint the [Outliers NFT](https://github.com/joycexjiang/floodgate-outliers-nft). This repository includes the smart contract as well as the web platform.

## Overview
Outliers is a 10-week, summer program to empower exceptional student builders in Crypto and Web3. Through curriculum and technical projects, Outliers equips students from across the country with the resources, knowledge, and community necessary to build and scale a successful Web3 venture. Cohort members will learn and build alongside talented peers, be matched with expert mentors, and have the opportunity to interact with world-class guest speakers. The community is backed by Floodgate, a top-tier seed-stage venture capital firm located in Silicon Valley with a track record of early investments in companies such as Lyft, Twitch, and Twitter.

Outliers 2022 will be organized as a DAO, seeded with $50k-$100k. The multi-sig will be handed over to members of the selected cohort; but, once the program is underway, we will reveal a big, audacious goal for this DAO. If students succeed, the DAO will live on.
